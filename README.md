# UWM-Capstone
Capstone Project: Gratify - 
Our goal with this project was to combine job boards and volunteering boards.
We hoped that by doing this we would put more eyes on volunteering.
This was meant to be the first iteration of a project in a agile project management methodology.
During this first and only sprint, I was responsible for about 90% of the html/php/sql and a large portion of the css.
Were were also expected to create a business model canvas and present both these things to real world IT professionals
There are so many more ideas I wanted to incorporate including Facebook login API, Real location services, Auto-filling events into the page, etc...
and I may continue working on this even past the presentation/graduation.
